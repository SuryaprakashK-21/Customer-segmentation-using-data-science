# Customer Segmentation Using Data Science

## Introduction

Customer segmentation is a crucial technique in marketing and business analytics, enabling organizations to divide their customer base into distinct groups for targeted marketing strategies. This project involves using K-Means clustering combined with Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.

## Objectives

- To implement customer segmentation using K-Means clustering on RFM values.
- To understand and interpret customer segments based on their behavioral patterns.
- To visualize the segments and provide actionable insights for business decisions.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: The dataset used in this project consists of transactional data with customer purchase history.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, handling missing values, and outlier detection are performed to prepare the dataset.
3. **RFM Analysis**: Calculate RFM values:
   - **Recency (R)**: Number of days since the last purchase.
   - **Frequency (F)**: Total number of purchases.
   - **Monetary (M)**: Total amount spent by the customer.
4. **K-Means Clustering**: Apply the K-Means clustering algorithm on normalized RFM values to create customer segments.
5. **Visualization**: Visualize the clusters using various plots to interpret customer behavior.
6. **Insights**: Analyze each customer segment and provide actionable insights for marketing and business strategies.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

### Python Libraries

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn

You can install these libraries using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Dataset Description

The dataset should contain the following columns:

- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **InvoiceDate**: Date of the transaction.
- **InvoiceNo**: Invoice number of the transaction.
- **Quantity**: Quantity of items purchased.
- **UnitPrice**: Price per unit item.
- **TotalPrice**: Total price for the transaction (calculated as Quantity * UnitPrice).

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SuryaprakashK-21/Customer-segmentation-using-data-science.git
cd Customer-segmentation-using-data-science
```

2. **Run the notebook**:

Use Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab to open and run `customer_segmentation.ipynb`.

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Load the dataset and preprocess it by handling missing values and outliers.
2. **Calculate RFM Values**: Use the provided script to calculate Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values for each customer.
3. **Run K-Means Clustering**: Apply K-Means clustering on the RFM data to create customer segments.
4. **Visualization and Analysis**: Use the visualizations to understand the characteristics of each customer segment.

## Results

- **Cluster Distribution**: [Provide a plot showing the number of customers in each segment.]
- **Customer Segment Analysis**: [Describe the characteristics of each customer segment, e.g., high-value customers, frequent buyers, etc.]
- **Business Insights**: [Provide actionable insights for each segment, such as tailored marketing strategies, retention plans, or potential upselling opportunities.]

## Future Improvements

- **Incorporate More Features**: Include additional features such as customer demographics or purchasing channels.
- **Use Advanced Clustering Techniques**: Experiment with hierarchical clustering or DBSCAN for better segmentation.
- **Automate the Segmentation Process**: Develop a pipeline to automate data preprocessing, clustering, and visualization.
